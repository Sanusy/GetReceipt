# GetReceipt
Simple Android library based on [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) that were implemented to practice with Android libraries
implementation and publishing it with [Jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io). Library provides access to some very basic API functions. 
## How to import
To import the library you need to add Jitpack.io repository to your project. If you are using Gradle 7 or above, go to `settings.gradle` and add a repository there.
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
If you are using an older version of Gradle, go to your project level `build.gradle` and add the repository:
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
And then add the dependency to your module level `build.gradle`:
```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.Sanusy.GetReceipt:final:publish'
}
```
